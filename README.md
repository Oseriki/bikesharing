### Result 2: Peak Hours and Bikes Utilization
Analysis shows that the peak ridind hours are from 8am in the morning and 7pm in the everning. Also, analysis shows the the bikes that are used more ferequently then others. This information when combined with the peak hours data can be used to identify bikes that can be taken off service and serviced or repaired during off peak period.

## Summary
All in all most of our users tend to be males with ride time under one hour. Also, we are able to identify low peak time betweem 11pm and 5am. Repairs and bike maintenance can be conducted during this times.

### Two additional visualizations suggestions for future analysis
- Trip duration (by user, by gender and checkout time) for other months. August seems to be a busy month for the bikesharing business. I think it will be important to about other months.
